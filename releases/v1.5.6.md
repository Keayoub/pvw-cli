# v1.5.6 Release Notes

## Fixes

- Fixed `UnicodeEncodeError` when printing term import/update progress on Windows PowerShell (CP-1252 encoding).
- Replaced Unicode symbols (✓, ⚠, •) with ASCII-safe alternatives (OK, WARNING, -) in UC term commands.
- Consolidated Copilot agent instructions into unified profile (.github/agents/MyAgent.agent.md).

## Details

### Windows Console Compatibility
The `pvw uc term import-csv` and `pvw uc term update-csv` commands were crashing on Windows PowerShell when attempting to print status messages containing Unicode characters (checkmarks, bullet points, warning symbols). This was caused by the default CP-1252 encoding in Windows console environments not supporting these Unicode glyphs.

**Changes:**
- `✓` → `OK`
- `⚠` → `WARNING:`
- `•` → `-`

All status messages now use ASCII-only text with optional Rich color tags (`[green]`, `[yellow]`, `[red]`), ensuring Windows compatibility without losing readability.

### Agent Instructions
Unified two separate agent instruction files into a single `MyAgent.agent.md` containing:
- pvw-cli project structure and coding standards
- Windows console ASCII-only output requirements
- Common failure avoidance patterns
- Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit mapping reference
- Purview/UC integration guidance

## Testing

- Term import/update with custom attributes verified on Windows PowerShell 7.x.
- Console output verified for ASCII-safe display on CMD and PowerShell.
- No functional changes to API behavior or term creation logic.
